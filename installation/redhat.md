## Install Inbucket on RedHat EL 6 or one of its clones

### 1. Copy Distribution

Move or copy your Inbucket distribution to the `/opt` directory.  I recommend
you keep the version number or build date in the name, and create a symbolic
link from `inbucket` to that name to make upgrading/downgrading easier.

Example assuming you had a binary distribution tarball in root's home directory:

~~~ sh
cd /opt
tar xzvf ~/inbucket_VER_linux_amd64.tar.gz
ln -s inbucket_VER_linux_amd64/ inbucket
cd inbucket/etc/redhat-el6
~~~

The steps below should be run as root from the `etc/redhat-el6` directory within
your Inbucket source or binary distribution.


### 2. Create Service Account

Create a service account for the daemon to run under.

*NOTE:* there is a [setcap] command in the init script that allows inbucket to
listen on privileged ports (such as 25 and 80) without running as root.

~~~ sh
useradd -r -m inbucket
~~~


### 3. Create Data Store

Create the directory where mail will be stored and make it writable by inbucket:

~~~ sh
mkdir /var/opt/inbucket
chown inbucket: /var/opt/inbucket
~~~


### 4. Setup Log Rotation

Copy logrotate config into place, it should inherit most of the defaults setup
in `/etc/logrotate.conf`

~~~ sh
cp inbucket.logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/inbucket
chown root: /etc/logrotate.d/logrotate
~~~


### 5. Install Init Script

Copy init script into place and activate:

~~~ sh
cp inbucket-init.sh /etc/init.d
chown root: /etc/init.d/inbucket
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/inbucket
chkconfig --add inbucket
~~~


### 6. Configure Inbucket
Copy the sample config into place:

~~~ sh
cp ../unix-sample.conf /etc/opt/inbucket.conf
chown root: /etc/opt/inbucket.conf
~~~

Confirm the contents of `/etc/opt/inbucket.conf` are to your liking.


### 7. Start Inbucket

Start the daemon and check for errors

1. Start the daemon: <kbd>service inbucket start</kbd>
2. Confirm it stayed running: <kbd>service inbucket status</kbd>
3. Check inbucket's startup messages: <kbd>less /var/log/inbucket.log</kbd>
