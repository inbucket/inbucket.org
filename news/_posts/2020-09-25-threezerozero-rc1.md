The first release candidate for Inbucket 3.0.0 is out!

**What's New:**

The biggest change from the 2.x series is a brand new user interface that makes
Inbucket feel much more like an application than a website.

Other significant changes include the ability include the domain in a mailbox
name (see `INBUCKET_MAILBOXNAMING`), and a configurable URL base path
(`INBUCKET_WEB_BASEPATH`) to aid in placing Inbucket behind an application
proxy.
