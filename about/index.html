    <p> Inbucket is an email testing application; it will accept messages for
    any email address and make them available to view via a web interface.  If
    you've ever used <a href="http://mailinator.com"
    target="_blank">mailinator.com</a>, you already have a good idea of what
    Inbucket does.  The benefit of Inbucket is that it is an application instead
    of a hosted service; you may run it on your own private network, or even your
    desktop. </p>

    <p> Inbucket allows web developers, software engineers and system
    administrators to quickly see the emailed output of their applications.  No
    per-account setup is required! Mailboxes are created on the fly as mail is
    received for them, and no password is required to browse the content of the
    mailboxes.  </p> <p> Inbucket has built-in SMTP and POP3 servers which
    store incoming mail as flat files on disk &ndash; no external SMTP or
    database daemons required.  </p> <p> Inbucket was written in <a
    href="http://golang.org/">Google Go</a> and is open source software
    released under the MIT License. </p>
